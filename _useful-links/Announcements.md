<p><strong>Teachers’ Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear SKSS Alumni,</p>
<p>As we prepare to celebrate Teachers' Day, we would like to inform you
that our teachers will be leaving school early after participating in a
special appreciation programme in the morning. Whilst we deeply value your
thoughtful intention to visit your former teachers, they will unfortunately
be unavailable to receive visitors on this day. Do look forward to an Alumni
Day in 2026.</p>
<p>We’ve set up a special online platform for you to leave your Teachers’
Day well-wishes and messages. Whether it’s a heartfelt thank you, a memorable
classroom moment, or a simple note to say you remember them - your words
will mean the world to our teachers. <strong>Leave your message here: </strong>

</p>
<p>Let’s come together as a SKSS family to honour the educators who’ve made
a difference in our lives. We appreciate your continued support and connection
with our teachers and school community.</p>
