Dear Parents/ Guardians and Secondary 1 students

1.       Welcome to Seng Kang Secondary School (SKSS)! Congratulations to all students on your posting to SKSS to commence your secondary school education. It will be a new phase of your development and we are happy to welcome you to be part of the family.

2\.       The Secondary One Registration process will be conducted online, so the Secondary One students are **not required** to report in person on Registration Day. The designated primary contact of the child would receive a Parent Gateway (PG) notification from us, directing you to the Online Registration Portal and other relevant information, from the afternoon of the S1 School Posting Day. You will be informed of your child’s form class from 30 December 2022 onwards via PG.


3\.       **Online Registration Portal**

(a)      Go to [https://go.gov.sg/s1registration-ay2023](https://go.gov.sg/s1registration-ay2023) . The online registration will open on Registration Day, **a day after the S1 School Posting results.**


(b)      The registration takes about 15 minutes. Please complete all fields.

(c)      **It is compulsory for parents/ guardians to complete the registration**. Please complete the registration latest by **24 December 2022, Saturday, 11:59 pm.**
