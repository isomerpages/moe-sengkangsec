4.       **Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)**

          **Purpose of FSBB**

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

From 2024, Secondary 1 students will be able to offer subjects at three levels: G1/G2/G3 (G stands for General), mapped from today’s N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. All secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

* Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum; and
* Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary Two.

**FSBB in Seng Kang Secondary in 2023**

The Secondary One students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Students will attend lessons in the form classes for the following subjects: Character and Citizenship Education, Music, Physical Education, Art, Design & Technology, as well as Food and Consumer Education.

English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science will continue to be offered at Express, Normal (Academic) and Norma (Technical) level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.
