“The content of your character is your choice. <br>
Day by day, what you think and what you do, is who you become”

In 2021, the Discussion of Contemporary Issues (CI) became a regular feature in the Character Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons. In preparation for its implementation, a staff training workshop was held in December 2020 to lay the groundwork for teachers to plan and implement an engaging lesson in which the pedagogy and focus are different from the rest of the CCE curriculum. The CI lessons were a regular feature of the National Education (NE) days, Safer Internet Day and also in the day-to-day CCE curriculum lessons where contemporary issues were relevant to the topics being discussed.

The inaugural Student Voices Campaign was also implemented school-wide in our attempts to provide a platform for student ownership and to build a caring and enabling school. The student leaders were trained to conduct the lesson as well as collate and present their findings and suggestions for improvements to the Student Development Committee for endorsement before the actual implementation was carried out.
