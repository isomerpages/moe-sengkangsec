<p>The aim of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is to equip our students
with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each
key education stage to ensure a successful transition to post-secondary
education or work. ECG guidance lessons are incorporated into CCE curriculum
where students learn about their strengths, talents and values. At the
same time they are also engaged in exploring education pathways and the
world of work. The MySkillsFuture.sg, a web-based portal is also utilised
to facilitate education and career development among students in Singapore.
Other platforms to engage our students in exploring ECG included invitations
to alumni, post-secondary institutional partners, parents and experiential
learning from post-secondary orientation programmes and industrial visits.</p>
