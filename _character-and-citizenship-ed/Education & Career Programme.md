</font>**<br>
The aim of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each key education stage to ensure a successful transition to post-secondary education or work. ECG guidance lessons are incorporated into CCE curriculum where students learn about their strengths, talents and values. At the same time they are also engaged in exploring education pathways and the world of work. The MySkillsFuture.sg, a web-based portal is also utilised to facilitate education and career development among students in Singapore. Other platforms to engage our students in exploring ECG included invitations to alumni, post-secondary institutional partners, parents and experiential learning from post-secondary orientation programmes and industrial visits.
