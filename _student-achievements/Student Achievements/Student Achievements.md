**<font size=5>The ignITE Challenge 2021</font>**

The ignITE Challenge 2021 was organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). This challenge is an annual competition that introduces students to technical skills and fosters a deeper understanding of courses offered by ITE.

**Fourteen of our secondary 3 students from class 3-8**, took part in this challenge, specifically representing the school the Daedalus Challenge and the Dancing Drones Challenge.

In the Daedalus Challenge, students developed their skills in using the Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to design and assemble an aerodynamic glider that can clear obstacles. While in the Dancing Drones Challenge, students learnt how to execute drone programming using the Python codebase, and perform simultaneous flying of multiple drones.

We are proud that the team, comprising of **Muhammad Hafy Ismat Bin Rahmat, Mohammad Danish Bin Mohammad Razak and Mohamed Fajarbaadillah Bin Mohamed Mustafah**, emerged as finalists for the Dancing Drone Challenge. Great effort boys!

The Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence was first presented in 2005. It recognises well-rounded students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and who exemplify the qualities artculated in the desired outcomes of education. This year, Siti Nur Zhafirah Bte Mohd Fadzil and Darrell Wee Jun Kai received the Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence.  

This is a major breakthrough for the school as this is the 1st time our students receive such high accolades at the national level. Darrell was an active member of the Football CCA Team and represented the school in several competitons. He was also member of the Sports Leaders Executive Committee. He excelled in both his academic pursuits and Co-curricular activities, and was a role model to many of his peers.

We also like to congratulate Siti Nur Zhafirah, Company Leader of the Girl Guides. She was also a dedicated member of the Student Council. For her active contribution and capable leadership, she was given a special mention by the Minister of Education in his opening speech!

Congratulations Darrell and Zhafirah! SKSS is very proud of your achievements & all the best in your future pursuits.
