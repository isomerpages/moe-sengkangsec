The ignITE Challenge 2021 was organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). This challenge is an annual competition that introduces students to technical skills and fosters a deeper understanding of courses offered by ITE.

**Fourteen of our secondary 3 students from class 3-8**, took part in this challenge, specifically representing the school the Daedalus Challenge and the Dancing Drones Challenge.

In the Daedalus Challenge, students developed their skills in using the Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to design and assemble an aerodynamic glider that can clear obstacles. While in the Dancing Drones Challenge, students learnt how to execute drone programming using the Python codebase, and perform simultaneous flying of multiple drones.

We are proud that the team, comprising of **Muhammad Hafy Ismat Bin Rahmat, Mohammad Danish Bin Mohammad Razak and Mohamed Fajarbaadillah Bin Mohamed Mustafah**, emerged as finalists for the Dancing Drone Challenge. Great effort boys!
