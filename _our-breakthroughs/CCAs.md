<p>This year, Seng Kang Secondary School’s C Division Football team achieved
a significant milestone by securing 3rd place in the Breakthrough League
2 Championships. Their exceptional performance not only earned them a podium
finish but also qualified the team for the prestigious C Division League
1 next year. This remarkable success is a testament to the boys’ unwavering
tenacity, resilience, and commitment throughout the season. Their dedication
to training and improvement reflects the values instilled in them both
on and off the field. The team’s achievement would not have been possible
without the steadfast support of parents, SFA coaches and zonal managers,
teachers, and school leaders, including the Head of Department for PE/CCA,
whose guidance and encouragement played a crucial role. This collective
effort underscores the importance of community in fostering excellence,
and we look forward to seeing our players continue to grow and excel in
League 1 next season.</p>

<p>NPCC has played a crucial role in my personal growth, helping me become
more resilient and adaptable since my reserved lower secondary days. I’m
grateful to Mr. Noah Zhang and Ms. Amanda Lee for their immense support
