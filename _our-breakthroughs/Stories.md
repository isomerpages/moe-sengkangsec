<p><strong>National Day Parade 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>We are proud to share that our students from Seng Kang Secondary School
were involved in the National Day Parade 2024 held on 9th August. Our students
took part in the pre-parade segment, contributing to the celebration of
Singaporeâ€™s 59th birthday with enthusiasm and dedication. Their involvement
in such a prestigious national event highlights the spirit of community,
patriotism, and pride that we instill in our students. Congratulations
to all our participants for representing our school with such energy and
passion!</p>
