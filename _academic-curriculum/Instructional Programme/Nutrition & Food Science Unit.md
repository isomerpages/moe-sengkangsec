**<font size=5>Beliefs</font>**

The Nutrition & Food Science Unit is committed to developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes required by the students to succeed in the  21st century. The focus is on improving the lives of those around them through knowledge in nutrition and health, food literacy and food science. We utilise the Inquiry-based Learning pedagogy, which enables the students to relate and apply knowledge learnt to real-life situations. The cyclical process engages the students with tasks that lead to intellectual exploration, explanation of information and application of ideas.

**Lower Secondary:** 

Our students are exposed to investigative food science experiments where the inquiry-based learning model is used to facilitate the discussion and exploration of the functions of different ingredients used in food preparation. Students get the opportunity to  modify recipes and examine the food characteristics on the final product by conducting sensory evaluation.     

**Upper Secondary:** 

The self-directed learning and inquiry-based learning approach were used to encourage our students to champion sustainability efforts; especially on sustainable food consumption. As the nation moves towards reducing food wastes, our students also embarked on a project to identify current food consumption practices and their impact on the environment. Through the project, they learnt to select food from sustainable sources and apply sustainable food consumption guidelines in the preparation and cooking of food. The learning was shared with family and friends to raise awareness on the importance of practicing sustainable food consumption.

Our heartiest congratulations to Mohammed Aiman Zulkhair Bin Mohammed, Goh Dong Ce Cipher, Loh Yu Wei Kyran, Vaanisri D/O Parameswaran and Tan Jing Hui Karrise from class 3-7 for achieving the first position at the Health & Food Science Competition (Nutri-booster Competition 2021) organised by The Science Centre and Republic Polytechnic.  
  

During the 3 month long competition, our students had to complete a nutrition canvas, film and edit the process of preparing a dish and dietary supplement for a specific target group and finally present their findings to the judges.

  

We would like to commend the students for demonstrating resourcefulness and tenacity during the competition. We would also like to thank Ms Kho Hui Han for her guidance throughout the competition.
