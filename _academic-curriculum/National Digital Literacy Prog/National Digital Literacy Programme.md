<p>In March 2020, during MOE's Committee of Supply Debate, the Ministry of
Education introduced the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) to
enhance digital literacy for students in schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning. A key aspect of the NDLP is the Personalized Digital Learning
Programme (PDLP), which ensures that all secondary school students are
provided with a school-approved Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p>
<p>Singapore citizens will be able to utilize the funds in their Edusave
account to&nbsp;offset the cost&nbsp;for their Personal Learning Device.
Students who are Singapore citizens from lower-income families will enjoy
further subsidies for the purchase.&nbsp;</p>
