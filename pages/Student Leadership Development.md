**Our Vision**<br>
Student leaders aim to be the bridge for the student body, serving the school in the spirit of unity.

**Our Mission**<br>
To develop all Seng Kang Youths to lead with character.

**Our Belief**<br>
The committee believes that leadership can be learnt and all students can be a leader in their own unique ways. We adopt the Student Leadership Challenge (SLC) model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner as our main training philosophy. SLC comprises five exemplary leadership practices - Model the Way, Inspired a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart. These leadership practices are aligned to the school values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.
