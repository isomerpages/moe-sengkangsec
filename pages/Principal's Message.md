**Let Your Dreams Set Sail!**

While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives, we have stayed resilient and found creative ways to keep up with meaningful work and play in school. Home-Based Learning, e-CCAs and Safe Management Measurements have become an increasingly normal feature of our lives. They have become so ingrained that our staff and students continue to nail their commitment in learning to the mast, and to steer a path forward courageously. 

  

This tenacity to stay the course amidst the volatility has earned my respect and admiration for my staff and students. Navigating these uncharted waters that were at times calm, and at other times, turbulent, we are constantly reminded not to take the little things for granted. In such times, attaining success is no mean feat, and our recent graduates have inspired us with their fortitude to triumph over challenges of the past year.

  

Come what may. I trust that the students are well anchored in values, knowledge and skills to be admirals of their own voyages. Do remember that wherever you may venture as let your dreams set sail, you will always find a home at SKSS.

  

Please continue to stay safe, stay curious and stay on course!

Thank you. 

  

**Mr Koh Yiak Kheng
