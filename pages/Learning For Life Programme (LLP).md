Sports and Outdoor Adventure are key platforms for character building and leadership development. They play a key role in building an inclusive community of active and healthy individuals. SKSS’s Learning for Life Programme aims to equip students with the knowledge to be critical and inventive thinker, the skills to be a competent and confident leader, the attitude to be gracious and cultured citizens and to be healthy and active youth. The programme seeks to nurture students to be learners for life by enabling them to be stronger athletes, tougher individuals and better learners.

This programme will enable students to better understand how Sports Science benefits a person physically, mentally and socially. All students will undergo a Basic Sports Science (BSS) Programme to build resilience as they face different challenges in their lives. This programme will also provide opportunities for students to be self-directed learners by allowing them to take ownership of their own learning. In addition, student-athletes in sports CCA teams will go through a rigorous Sports CCA Programme built upon a strong foundation of character development and emphasis on being stronger through Sports Science.

Students across all levels are taught a myriad of sports skills and key aspects of healthy living through a rigorous PE program. They will have opportunities to apply what they have learnt in a competitive setting at various levels. 

Through a vibrant sports culture, our school seeks to develop active and healthy students of character, enabling them to act as advocates who promote a healthy lifestyle to their peers, family and the community. They will embody the school’s values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience advocating the motto: “Leading an active and healthy lifestyle is everyone’s responsibility.”

For those with a passion for Sports and Outdoor Adventure, there are programmes such as the Sports Leaders Programme and Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Programme to help students develop their leadership skills to lead their peers in the various level-wide programmes. They will serve as role models and be ambassadors of healthy and active living. They will play a key role in building an active and inclusive community.
