**Learning for Life (LLP) @ Seng Kang Secondary School**

TREK for Life

Seng Kang Secondary School (SKSS) was awarded Niche Status to develop hockey as a niche sport in the school in May 2009. This award has been a culmination of many years of sustained achievement by the schoolâ€™s various hockey teams in the national competitions. In 2014, our Niche status was converted into the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Building Character through Sports and Outdoor Adventure. And this year in 2024, Seng Kang Secondary School has reviewed its Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and rebranded it into TREK for Life as our new LLP initiatives.
