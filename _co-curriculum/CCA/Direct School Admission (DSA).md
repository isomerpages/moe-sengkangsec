<p><strong>Learning for Life (LLP) @ Seng Kang Secondary School</strong> 
<br><strong><u>TREK for Life</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Seng Kang Secondary School (SKSS) was awarded Niche Status to develop
hockey as a niche sport in the school in May 2009. This award has been
a culmination of many years of sustained achievement by the school’s various
hockey teams in the national competitions. In 2014, our Niche status was
converted into the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Building Character
through Sports and Outdoor Adventure. And this year in 2024, Seng Kang
Secondary School has reviewed its Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and
rebranded it into <strong><u>TREK for Life</u></strong> as our new LLP initiatives.</p>
