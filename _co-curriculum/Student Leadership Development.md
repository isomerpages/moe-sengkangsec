**Our Vision**<br>
Student leaders aim to be the bridge for the student body, serving the school in the spirit of unity.

**Our Mission**<br>
To develop all Seng Kang Youths to lead with character.

**Our Belief**<br>
The committee believes that leadership can be learnt and all students can be a leader in their own unique ways. We adopt the Student Leadership Challenge (SLC) model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner as our main training philosophy. SLC comprises five exemplary leadership practices - Model the Way, Inspired a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart. These leadership practices are aligned to the school values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.

</font>**<br>
SKSS Student Leadership Development has two broad areas of focus, namely

**(i) School-wide Student Leadership Development Curriculum**<br>
Guided by the school’s desired student outcomes and the SLC practices, the school-wide Student Leadership Development Curriculum is designed in a spiral manner. The curriculum aims to establish a common language of leadership across the school and equip all students with the fundamentals to be leaders of self.  

**(ii) Specialised programmes for SKSS Student Leaders Board**

SKSS Student Leaders Board comprises Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Sports Leaders, CCA Leaders and Class Leaders. Based on students' readiness and leadership potential, students are selected to take up various leadership appointments in the different domains of school life. Selected students go through specialized training and are given opportunities to stretch their acquisition and application of leadership skills.

**01\. Student Council**<br>
The Student Council assumes the highest level of Student Leadership in Seng Kang Secondary School. As representatives of the epitome of the Seng Kang Youth, the Student Councillors serve as character and leadership role models for their peers. They serve the school by maintaining the discipline and decorum of the student population through the conduct of daily duties, and serve the interests of the students through the organisation and execution of school events and celebrations. The Student Council plans various events every year, including Teacher’s Day Celebrations and the Student Leaders Camp, where they are constantly challenged to stretch their limits and apply the concepts learnt from the Student Leadership Challenge. Through these experiences and activities, the Student Councillors develop their leadership skills to become high quality leaders of tomorrow.

**02.&nbsp;Peer Support Leaders**<br>
The Peer Support Leaders are the heart of the students, as they assist in cultivating a caring and enabling school environment and strengthen the network of positive relationships, which have a positive impact on student achievement and well-being. They help to keep a lookout for students, showing empathy to reach-out those who may feel lonely and isolated. They are also patient to provide a listening ear and support to students who may be in distress, influencing them to be more optimistic. The Peer Support Leaders are our ambassadors of peer support relations - encouraging Peer Bonding, Peer Helping and Peer Influencing.

**03\. Sports Leaders**&nbsp;<br>
The Sports Leaders are the energizers who serve the school in creating a vibrant, inclusive and active learning environment for the students. They encourage students to be healthy and active youths by hosting regular unstructured play sessions. They also help to plan and organise Sports events within the school and participate in outreach activities at Primary Schools, as umpires and other sports officials. The Sports Leaders are enthusiastic advocates of the school’s Learning for Life Programme - building character through sports and outdoor adventure learning.
