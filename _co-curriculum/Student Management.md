“To discipline is to care”

  

The key strategy for developing good discipline is to build our student’s social and emotional competencies by creating a supportive environment; teaching values and social and emotional skills; providing opportunities for students to exercise good behaviour; and guiding and re-orienting students towards exemplary behaviour. Effective discipline also requires collaboration among stakeholders.

**Collaboration with Sengkang NPC and the Singapore Police Force**<br>
Seng Kang Secondary School works closely with Seng Kang Neighbourhood Police Station to bring light to crime prevention to ensure students’ safety. We also work together to nurture at-risk students through focus group discussions and one-on-one sessions with officer mentors. This year, the police launched Project Green Leaf 2.0, to help mentor students with discipline issues.&nbsp;  

  

**Model Class Award 2021**<br>
The Model Class Award aims to acknowledge and provide formal recognition to the classes that consistently put in effort to create a positive classroom climate that supports the well-being and achievement of all students.&nbsp;<br>
The following classes displayed exemplary behaviour and were bestowed the Model Class Award 2021: Secondary 1-4, Secondary 2-4, Secondary 3-2 and Secondary 4-6. Students from these classes exhibited the school values, displayed high levels of self-discipline and were engaged learners who served as role models for their peers.<br>
GEAR-UP (Guiding &amp; Empowering students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential)<br>
The GEAR-UP Programme is intended as a school-based integrated support programme to enhance students’ learning motivation. Students participate in meaningful learning activities after curriculum hours to acquire new skills and knowledge. Students step out of their comfort zones and become more self-cognizant.&nbsp;

**Special Needs Education**<br>
**1\. Special Needs Education Workshop**&nbsp;<br>
Selected teachers attended a workshop to aid them in understanding Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Through experiential learning, participating teachers learnt how to better empathise and support our students.  
  
**2\. Building Whole-School Community of Support**<br>
An online workshop was conducted via Zoom as part of the school’s Professional Development for teachers, to advocate a whole-school approach when supporting students with special educational needs. Teachers were introduced to the relevant resources and specialists in the school whom they can turn to for support.

  

**3\. Focused Group Discussion to Support Students with Dyslexia**<br>
These small-group workshops imparted strategies to teachers to help students with Dyslexia. These strategies, which teachers tried out at the workshops, include the teaching of morphemes and the use of word maps and semantic gradients.
