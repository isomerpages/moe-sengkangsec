Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) and Sengkang Community Hospital (SKCH) form a vital part of Sengkang community in offering a wide spectrum clinics which deliver multi-disciplinary and patient-centric care of all major healthcare disciplines.   

It takes a village to achieve better health together and that village begins with the hospitals. At SKH, they believe that every player in the village is equally important in building a healthier community in the northeast. Over the past years, they have strived with their alliance and community partners to achieve their mission of Better Health Together. Great strides have been made in fostering greater awareness of healthy living among residents, as well as promoting greater collaboration with general practitioners (GPs) to build healthier communities in Punggol and Sengkang. This is integral to the hospital’s efforts and long-term commitment of encouraging residents to take an active role in their own health care.

  

As part of the Seng Kang village,, Seng Kang Secondary School becomes one of the official partners with the SKH and SKCH in mid 2018. Since then, we actively participate in the hospital's various key events and our students volunteer in aspects in helping the hospitals to build a healthier community in the North-East of Singapore.
