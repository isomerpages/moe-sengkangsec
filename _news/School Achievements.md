On 15 February 2018, a historical event was held with the entire school community participating in the Lunar New Year Mass Lo Hei (a Singaporean Chinese New Year tradition of tossing the Chinese raw fish salad which bodes good fortune and blessings).

On 23 March, the school organised a Record-breaking Event in line with the school’s 20th Anniversary celebrations, held at the Seng Kang Sports Complex.Together, the school staff and students not only broke one but three Singapore records: the ‘Largest display of paper sailboats’, ‘Largest Tabata display’ and ‘Most number of push balls kept in the air’.

These feats were made possible only through a strong and united spirit of collaboration and community amongst staff and students.

Here’s to our ‘Next Breakthrough’!

2017 was a fruitful year for the school. Accolades in CCA continued.&nbsp;The feather in the cap was when SKSS Girls Guides achieved not only another Unit Gold Award but also a harvest of 4 Guides getting the individual Baden Powell Award.

  

On 12 May 2017, the school had the honour to host a Guinness World Record event with the unwavering support of SKSS’ SAC Vice-Chairman, Dato’ Seri Dr Toh Soon Huat. He arranged for one of the school’s community partners, Sian Chay Medical Institution, to hold its&nbsp;Guinness Record Event of the World’s Largest Artificial Flower Bouquet in the school hall.

  

The record-breaking flower bouquet was made up of a total of 41,249 blooms of carnations, in the shape of a giant heart measuring 13m across and 9.5m in depth. Thereafter, the school staff and student volunteers helped to distribute the artificial carnations to mothers in the neighbourhood to celebrate Mothers’ Day.&nbsp;

  

At the 2017 GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, the school attained yet another academic breakthrough when one of our students, Choong Kai Jie, scored 7A1s, clinching wonderful academic honours for the school and himself.
