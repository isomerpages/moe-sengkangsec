<p><strong>Beliefs</strong>
</p>
<p>Quality and Innovation – The Way to Success</p>
<p>The department believes that authentic learning and student engagement
are key to developing and preparing the students for the 21st Century.
Our collective aim is to design authentic lessons that are relevant to
the syllabus. Thus, Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills,
as well as Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills are
continually interwoven into our curriculum.</p>
<p>To enrich students’ learning of the various Humanities subjects across
various levels, the Humanities Department adopts a developmental structure
for Humanities Investigation using Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL). The vehicle
to develop these skills in our students is through the IBL fieldwork investigation
packages, which provide teachers with the opportunity to align the lower
and upper secondary syllabuses to facilitate greater depth of learning,
subject mastery and progressive development of skills in the students.</p>
<p>Tapping on digital technologies, the department also explored and adopted
various Blended learning approaches, which enabled the students to effectively
and collaboratively learn the Humanities subjects of Social Studies, Geography
and History through various modes of asynchronous learning and adaptive
learning platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Signature Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One Geographical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Integrated Geography/CCE LJ to Lorong Halus </strong>
<br>The Secondary One students participate in experiential outdoor learning
journeys as part of their Geographical Investigation. They engage in fieldwork
activities such as observing their surroundings and sketching the human
activities to deepen their learning and understanding of a particular geographical
phenomenon and its impact on life and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One Historical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Learning Journey to National Museum of Singapore and Fort Canning park; Leveraging on ICT to Facilitate Historical Investigation</strong> 
<br>Unlike in previous years when our Secondary One students engaged in museum-based
learning as part of their&nbsp; Historical Investigation (HI), we leveraged
on the use of ICT this year to facilitate the students’ HI projects, which
focused on the concept of Historical Evidence. Through the Student Learning
Space, we conducted a pre-HI lesson to help the students better understand
the definition of ‘archaeology’ and the work of archaeologists. Then, the
students carried out their individual research on various archaeological
sources during the Home-based Learning period to address the Inquiry Question,
‘Was Singapore a safe place for the migrants during the British colonial
period?’ The students recorded their findings and inferences on Google
Classroom. Subsequently, the students collaborated with their group members
through various ICT platforms, such as Google Meet, Google Doc and Google
Slides, to write a story about the lives of people who lived in Singapore
during the British colonial period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Two Historical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Exploring Change and Continuity in the Lives of People Living in Sengkang and Punggol</strong> 
<br>The Secondary Two Historical Investigation project required students to
investigate ‘How far has life changed for people living in Sengkang and
Punggol after World War Two?’ The students were required to examine several
aspects of the inquiry question. Each group member researched a particular
area, such as Housing and Living Conditions, Economic Activities and Jobs,
Leisure and Entertainment, and Types or Modes of Transport. The groups
then consolidated their findings and examined the change and continuity
in the various aspects of the lives of the people living in Sengkang and
Punggol. Finally, they presented their findings through a PowerPoint or
video presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Three Geographical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Virtual Coastal Investigation</strong> 
<br>In this new innovative Inquiry-based project, the Secondary Three Geography
students conducted their physical geographical investigations and inquiry
on the coastal formations and phenomenon along the coasts of Singapore
through various visual-audio platforms. In a safe indoor adapted environment,
the students were given the opportunity to explore the various stations
to learn about Singapore’s coastal surroundings through the use of virtual
sensory fieldwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Three Historical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Using Historical Sources and Evidence to Evaluate Stalin’s Leadership of the Soviet Union</strong> 
<br>The students explored the topic ‘Stalin’s rule over the Soviet Union’
through the study of various historical evidence. Working in groups, the
students analysed textual and pictorial sources, including propaganda posters
and political cartoons, to understand how Stalin ruled the Soviet Union
and the impact of his rule on the country and its people. Through this
approach, the students also developed their source-based skills such as
making inferences, drawing comparisons, detecting bias and evaluating reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements and Recognition</strong>
</p>
<p>With the guidance of Ms Kathleen Kwan, our Geography team of Tong Mao
Gen, Mogens of Secondary 4-1, Darryl Mok Kai Lun, Jolie Ong Vee Voon and
Ho Xuan Ying, Evelyn of Secondary 4-2, took part in the NUS Geography Challenge
2021, an annual competition jointly organised by the NUS Department of
Geography and the NUS Geographical Society.&nbsp; Darryl Mok further brought
honours to the school with him clinching one of the Individual Bronze awards.</p>
<p>With the guidance of Mr Noah Zhang, two teams from Seng Kang Secondary
School, comprising Secondary 2 Geography students, participated in the
Asia Oceania Geographical Society - Earth Observatory Observatory of Singapore
(EOS) International Geoscience Challenge 2021.&nbsp; The teams started
preparing since January and made it to the finals held virtually on 4th
August 2021.</p>
<p>The AOGS-EOS International Geoscience Challenge 2021 is part of the organizations’
effort to inspire and create greater interest in Geophysical Sciences among
middle and high school students. The aim of the Challenge is to give students
the experience of conducting an investigative Geoscience project under
the guidance of their geography teachers and provide students with a platform
to exhibit and share their findings with others.</p>
<p>Despite the constraints posed by safe management measures on their research
preparation, we are proud that both teams gave their best, and they motivated
and encouraged one other to stay focused throughout this competition. We
would like to acknowledge all of their incredible efforts to prepare the
research proposals, posters, videos, and the final presentation. Excellent
work, students!</p>
