<p><strong>Beliefs</strong>
</p>
<p>Quality and Innovation – The Way to Success</p>
<p>The department believes that authentic learning and student engagement
are key to developing and preparing the students for the 21st Century.
Our collective aim is to design authentic lessons that are relevant to
the syllabus. Thus, Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills,
as well as Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills are
continually interwoven into our curriculum.</p>
<p>To enrich students’ learning of the various Humanities subjects across
various levels, the Humanities Department adopts a developmental structure
for Humanities Investigation using Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL). The vehicle
to develop these skills in our students is through the IBL fieldwork investigation
packages, which provide teachers with the opportunity to align the lower
and upper secondary syllabuses to facilitate greater depth of learning,
subject mastery and progressive development of skills in the students.</p>
<p>Tapping on digital technologies, the department also explored and adopted
various Blended learning approaches, which enabled the students to effectively
and collaboratively learn the Humanities subjects of Social Studies, Geography
and History through various modes of asynchronous learning and adaptive
learning platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Signature Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One Geographical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Integrated Geography/CCE LJ to Lorong Halus </strong>
<br>The Secondary One students participate in experiential outdoor learning
journeys as part of their Geographical Investigation. They engage in fieldwork
activities such as observing their surroundings and sketching the human
activities to deepen their learning and understanding of a particular geographical
phenomenon and its impact on life and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One Historical Investigation &amp; Inquiry: Learning Journey to National Museum of Singapore and Fort Canning park; Leveraging on ICT to Facilitate Historical Investigation</strong> 
<br>Historical Investigation is an integral part of the new Lower Secondary
History curriculum. In 2023, as part of their Historical Inquiry research,
the Sec 1 level made a learning journey to National Museum of Singapore
and Fort Canning park, to learn more about the lifestyles, living conditions,
different economic and social activities of the different groups of early
immigrants. This History IBL project was designed to facilitate opportunities
for students to make better meaning of Singapore Today based on their discovery
of Singapore’s past.</p>
<p>In addition, the department also leveraged on the department created archaeological
dig sandbox and ICT to facilitate the students’ HI projects, which focused
on the concept of Historical Evidence. Through the archaeological sandbox,
we helped the students better understand the definition of ‘archaeology’
and the work of archaeologists. Then, the students further carried out
their individual research on various archaeological and internet sources
to write a story about the lives of people who lived in Singapore during
the British colonial period.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Two Integrated Learning Journey for Geographical &amp; Historical Investigation: Exploring Change and Continuity in the Lives of People Living in Sengkang and Punggol</strong> 
<br>The Secondary Two Historical Investigation project required students to
investigate ‘How far has life changed for people living in Sengkang and
Punggol after World War Two?’ The students went on a learning journey to
Punggol Town Hub and Punggol Waterway which they were required to examine
several aspects of the inquiry question. Each group member researched a
particular area, such as Housing and Living Conditions, Economic Activities
and Jobs, Leisure and Entertainment, and Types or Modes of Transport. The
groups then consolidated their findings and examined the change and continuity
in the various aspects of the lives of the people living in Sengkang and
Punggol. Finally, they presented their findings through a PowerPoint or
video presentation.</p>
