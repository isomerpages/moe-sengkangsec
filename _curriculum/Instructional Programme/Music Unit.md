At Seng Kang Secondary School, we believe that every student can appreciate music and engage in the art of music-making regardless of their background or experience. Our Music curriculum is designed to make musical learning as engaging and authentic as possible while providing our students with the opportunity to develop transferrable 21st Century Competencies and skills like self-directed learning, effective communication and responsible decision making.

Our Music curriculum aims to equip students with musical understandings and encourages them to be confident musicians who enjoy engaging with the various aspects of Music: Listening, Performing and Composing.

A team, led by our Music teacher, Mr Gerald Teh, presented on the good practices and achievements of the Art and Music departments with the rest of the Singapore teaching fraternity at the recent Teacher Conference and Excel Festival in 2023.
 
Mr Gerald Teh, in collaboration with the Singapore Teachers’ Academy for the Arts, published his critical inquiry project, ‘The Impact of Differentiated Tasks on Student Motivation, in the e-publication, ‘Sounding the Teaching V: Technology and Inclusion in Pedagogy’.
