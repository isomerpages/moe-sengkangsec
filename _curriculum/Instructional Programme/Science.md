**<font size=5>Beliefs</font>**

To engage, enthuse and inspire students to become active and confident learners in a scientific world, the Science Department employs Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) pedagogies and implements various programmes. The Science lessons focus on developing critical and inventive thinking skills in our students so they are able to relate scientific concepts that they have learnt to real life. Moreover, the Science teachers are constantly upgrading themselves to better their craft so that they can design the best lesson experiences for the students to get them interested in and even pursue a career in Science.

The Science curriculum focuses on the acquisition and application of various scientific concepts. Our students are not only engaged in lessons that apply IBL pedagogies, they are also engaged in various activities that make use of collaborative learning to enhance their learning. We believe in the application of science in all areas of life and thus collaborate with the ICT and CCE departments to carry out the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in school. Our ALP focuses on the area of Health Science and Technology and we make use of the Design Thinking Framework to allow students to find solutions to real-life problems. 

The Design Thinking Framework is applied by students to carry out Values in Action projects that involve the collaboration of the Science, ICT and CCE departments. This allows students to be provided with an authentic audience and learning experience so that they can generate solutions to solve existing issues that the elderly face. Furthermore, the programme allows students to design devices or living quarters to help the elderly as well as plan projects or workshops to aid the elderly in developing new skills.  

This interdisciplinary approach is unique as it aligns the various school programmes and provides students with authentic learning experiences to allow them to positively impact the community. Students who show an interest in ALP are trained by a dedicated group of teachers for various competitions.
