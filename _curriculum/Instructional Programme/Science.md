<p><strong>Beliefs</strong>
</p>
<p>To engage, enthuse and inspire students to become active and confident
learners in a scientific world, the Science Department employs Inquiry-based
Learning (IBL) pedagogies and implements various programmes. The Science
lessons focus on developing critical and inventive thinking skills in our
students so they are able to relate scientific concepts that they have
learnt to real life. Moreover, the Science teachers are constantly upgrading
themselves to better their craft so that they can design the best lesson
experiences for the students to get them interested in and even pursue
a career in Science.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Signature Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The Science curriculum focuses on the acquisition and application of various
scientific concepts. Our students are not only engaged in lessons that
apply IBL pedagogies, they are also engaged in various activities that
make use of collaborative learning to enhance their learning. We believe
in the application of science in all areas of life and thus collaborate
with the ICT and CCE departments to carry out the Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) in school. Our ALP focuses on the area of Health Science and Technology
and we make use of the Design Thinking Framework to allow students to find
solutions to real-life problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design Thinking Framework is applied by students to carry out Values
in Action projects that involve the collaboration of the Science, ICT and
CCE departments. This allows students to be provided with an authentic
audience and learning experience so that they can generate solutions to
solve existing issues that the elderly face. Furthermore, the programme
allows students to design devices or living quarters to help the elderly
as well as plan projects or workshops to aid the elderly in developing
new skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This interdisciplinary approach is unique as it aligns the various school
programmes and provides students with authentic learning experiences to
allow them to positively impact the community. Students who show an interest
in ALP are trained by a dedicated group of teachers for various competitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Achievements and Recognition 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sec 4 students have participated in the ITE Science Ignite Skills
Challenge in May 2024. The Ignite Challenges are designed to be engaging
and fun so as to make learning enjoyable and memorable. After the preliminary
rounds from the various schools that have participated, the team comprising
three of our students were selected into the ITE Challenging Finals for
the Logistics Challenge category.</p>
<p>During the competition, our students were given a challenge to complete
a task using VR googles and drone and they did very well to complete the
tasks as a team within the stipulated time.&nbsp;</p>
