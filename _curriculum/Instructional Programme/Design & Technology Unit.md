**<font size=5>Beliefs</font>**

Through the teaching and learning of Design & Technology (D&T), we are committed to equip every child with the ability to solve real-world problems. Every child is engaged with activities, which allow them to use the design thinking process to improve life.

Our curriculum is based on three main justifications for design in general education:

*   Design develops innate abilities in solving real-world, ill-defined problems.
*   Design sustains cognitive development in the concrete or iconic modes of cognition.
*   Design offers opportunities for development of a wide range of abilities in nonverbal thought and communication. <br>
(Cross, N., 2007)

**Learning Through Play**

*    Secondary 2 students learn through manipulating IKEA blocks. These serve as an inspiration for their Animagine project, where they promote the importance of saving endangered animals. 

*   In 2020, the Secondary 3 students had the chance to design their SKY Learning Space. They had the autonomy to create a more conducive and creative learning environment. <br>

**Learning through Exploration with Everyday Objects**

The learning of technologies in upper secondary is very abstract and engaging for many students new to this topic. It is designed as a tactile learning experience as students tinker with everyday products such as nail clippers and can openers. Lessons are scaffolded and students construct their knowledge and understanding on how mechanisms work, while they ‘play’ with the product and watch slow motion video clips. For electronics, students get to tinker with real circuits and learn through disassembling products.

*   Learning through Exploration with Everyday Objects was one of the Keynote Presentations at the SKSS Learning Festival 2020.
*   The Learning through Play project was the recipient of the Coyote Fund.
