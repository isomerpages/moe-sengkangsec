<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (“NDLP”) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (“PDLP”) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (“PLD”).&nbsp;This webpage provides important information about
how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying
applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>
