**<font size=5>School based ICT help desk</font>**

The ICT Department will provide technical support to students. This is part of our efforts to ensure that there is minimum disruption to students’ learning.

There will be a fortnightly collection of faulty devices that will be sent via courier to the authorised service centre for repairs. The devices sent through the school may take between 4-8 weeks for repairs, depending on the extent of the damage and availability of parts.

Should there be a need to send the device for immediate repairs, or queries about the device, insurance and warranty, you may contact the device contractor directly.

**<font size=5>**Standard Operating Procedure**</font>**

**Reporting of Device Issues (hardware issues and damages)**

*   If students encounter issues with their devices in school, they may approach their school-based ICT support staff for assistance. They will perform basic troubleshooting and assist to log a case with contractor if needed. ([go.gov.sg/skssicthd](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e40b45c90a6810012db9175))
    
*   Should the device need to be fixed by the contractor, Parents/students can use the **fortnightly collection** service provided by the contractors to schools to send in their devices. Please note that only personal learning devices procured under PDLP device bulk tender are eligible for the fortnightly collection services provided by contractors.
    
*   The school ICT support team will liaise and confirm the fortnightly collection date and time with the contractor. Contractor will pick up the devices from school on the arranged date and time.
    
*   The devices (depending on the parts availability) will be fixed and returned to school the next \*\*fortnightly collection service\*\* day. If there are follow up actions required, contractor will contact parents/students directly (e.g. the damage is not covered under warranty and need consent to claim insurance to get the repairs done).
    
*   School-based service desk personnel will inform the students when they can collect back their devices.
    
*   Parents/students can also bring the device to the Contractor's Service Centre. Parents/students are advised to contact Contractor’s helpdesk (T: 800 852 8100). Parents/students will need the following information such as their device serial number, brand and model of the device, their name and contact number to log a case with the helpdesk.
    
*   Contractor’s helpdesk agent will advise parents/students on any further actions required (e.g. bringing their devices to the service centre for diagnosis or assessment of damage).
    
*   **Students can loan a device** from the school common pool for daily lessons **during the period of repair**
