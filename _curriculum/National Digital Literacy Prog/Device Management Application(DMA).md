<h4>Functions of the DMA</h4>
<p>A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all
PLDs purchased through the school and will be installed on all student-owned
devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components
which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’
cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mobile Device Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This
facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from
malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Classroom Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This enables
teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve
classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Usage Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This enables
the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful
limits for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>

<h4>Selecting After-School DMA Options for PLDs</h4>
<p>For parents/guardians who prefer alternative DMA settings after school
hours, they can choose from the following options:</p>
<p>• <strong>Option A</strong>: For parents/guardians who prefer to take charge
of the level of restrictions for their child’s/ward’s use of the device
after school hours regulated by the DMA.</p>
<p>• <strong>Option B</strong>: For parents/guardians who do not want their
child’s/ward’s use of the device after school hours to be regulated by
the DMA at all.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Default Option</strong> : For parents/guardians who want their
child’s/ward’s use of the device to be restricted only to teaching and
learning, and who prefer to follow the Default Setting as set by the school
for both during and after school hours.</p>
