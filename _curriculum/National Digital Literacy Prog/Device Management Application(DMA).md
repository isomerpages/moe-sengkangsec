<h4>Functions of the DMA</h4>
<p>A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all
PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned
devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components
which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’
cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mobile Device Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This
facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from
malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Classroom Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This enables
teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve
classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Usage Management Service.</strong>&nbsp;This enables
the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful
limits for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>
