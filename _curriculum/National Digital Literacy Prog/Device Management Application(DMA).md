#### Functions of the DMA

A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:

(a)  **Mobile Device Management Service.** This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.

(b) **Classroom Management Service.** This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.

(c) **Usage Management Service.** This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.
