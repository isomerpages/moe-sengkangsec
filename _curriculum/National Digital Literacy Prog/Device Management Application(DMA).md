<h4><strong>DMA Lightspeed: Managing Your Child's Digital Experience</strong></h4>
<p>Each device comes equipped with a Device Management Application called
Lightspeed, a software platform used for managing and monitoring digital
devices, particularly in educational settings. It can provide features
such as content filtering, screen time management, device monitoring, and
ensuring compliance with school policies on digital usage. It helps administrators
and parents oversee how devices are being used, keeping students safe and
focused during their learning.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of DMA options available for parents/guardian to opt
that best fits the needs of your child/ward.</p>

<h4><strong>DMA Change of Option Form</strong></h4>
<p>The DMA options can be adjusted throughout the academic year based on
your child/ward's changing needs and demonstrated responsibility with digital
devices. The default sleep time after school hours is set to 10pm.</p>
<p>Parents who would like to change the DMA option of their child may do
so. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/skssdmachange" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>
<h4><strong>Parents Opting for Option A</strong></h4>
<p>Parents will receive a notification through Parent Gateway once the DMA
settings are configured. A guide will be provided to assist parents in
creating a Parent Lightspeed account to access the portal.</p>
<h4><strong>Deprovision of DMA of PLDs</strong></h4>
<p>Deprovisioning will take place after your child's graduation. The school
will inform you of the specific dates and procedures closer to graduation
time.</p>
<p>The school will remove DMA (Device Management Application) and all school-installed
settings from your child's device. This means:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The device will be unlocked from school controls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School-installed applications will be removed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child will have full control of the device</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After Deprovisioning, the device will become a regular device for personal
use and the warranty coverage continues until its expiry date.</p>
