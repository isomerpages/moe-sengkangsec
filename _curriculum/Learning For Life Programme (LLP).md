<p><strong><em>“T.R.E.K for LIFE”</em></strong>
<br>Living actively is an important cornerstone for students at Seng Kang
Secondary. The current reality is that the youth of today will be confronted
with physical and mental health challenges in the future and it is important
that all students are informed and equipped with life-long learning habits
of thinking positively, resting well, eating right and keeping active.
The school’s Learning for Life Programme aims to nurture students to be
learners for life by enabling them to develop in these 4 domains which
aptly form the acronym T.R.E.K, depicting a long journey</p>

<p><strong><em>“Think Positive”</em></strong>
<br>Positive thinking is a powerful mindset that can significantly impact
our overall well-being and success in various aspects of life. It involves
cultivating an optimistic outlook and focusing on constructive thoughts,
even in challenging situations. Embracing positive thinking can bring about
improved mental health. By consciously choosing positive thoughts, we can
reduce stress and anxiety, hence creating a more conducive environment
for creativity, productivity, and emotional well-being.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Rest Well”</em></strong>
<br>Resting well is another pillar of overall health and well-being. Quality
sleep not only rejuvenates the body but also plays a vital role in cognitive
function, emotional stability, and immune system. Beyond sleep, taking
breaks during the day and allowing the mind to unwind contributes to improved
productivity and creativity. Adequate rest is key to maintaining a balanced
and fulfilling life.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Eat Right”</em></strong>
<br>Eating right is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle, influencing not
just physical well-being but also mental and emotional health. A balanced
and nutritious diet provides the body with essential nutrients and helps
prevent various health issues. By making informed and conscious choices
about what we eat, we empower ourselves to fuel our bodies with the nutrients
they need, promoting sustained energy, improved mood, and long-term health.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Keep Moving”</em></strong>
<br>Physical activity supports cardiovascular health, enhances muscular strength,
and improves flexibility, contributing to overall physical well-being.
Beyond the physical aspects, movement has a profound impact on mental health,
reducing stress, anxiety, and depression while promoting cognitive function
and creativity. Engaging in regular exercise also plays a crucial role
in weight management and can reduce the risk of various chronic diseases.
Furthermore, movement fosters social connections, whether through team
sports, group fitness classes, or simply taking a walk with a friend. Embracing
an active lifestyle not only enhances physical fitness but also elevates
mood, boosts self-esteem, and ultimately leads to a more vibrant and balanced
life.</p>
