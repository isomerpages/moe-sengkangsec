The English Language & Literature Department strives to design effective and engaging programmes that encourage authentic learning while allowing students to apply the language and literary skills learned to real-life settings so that they can confidently use them  meaningfully.   

The focus of the department’s core curriculum in English Language and Literature in English is a combination of the following teaching and learning strategies and tools: 

*   Productive Skills: Process Writing, Journalling and Gradual Release of Responsibility

*   Assessment for Learning: Effective Questioning and Teaching Actions

*   The Reading Programme encompasses daily silent reading and reading magazines.
*   ‘Recommended Reads’ is a programme that empowers students and enables them to share their favourite books with the school. 
*   Alternative Assessments for Secondary 1 to 3 students, including non-traditional modes of assessment, like video podcasts and group choral reading.
