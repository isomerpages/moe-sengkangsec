<p>Seng Kang Secondary School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to
ignite students’ interest in the field of “Health Science and Technology”
by creating opportunities to allow them to explore technology to develop
solutions towards better living.</p>
<p><strong>ALP Programme / Key Approaches</strong>
<br>The ALP is interdisciplinary in nature and makes use of the Design Thinking
Framework to encourage students to provide solutions to real-life problems.
Students get to understand their target audience through their VIA learning
journeys and design a solution to solve problems faced by their target
audience. In the process, the students work collaboratively and apply critical
thinking skills.</p>
