<h4><strong>Developing Civic Literacy Through Disability Sports Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Seng Kang Secondary School’s student development initiatives place strong
emphasis on developing civic literacy—an emerging 21st Century competency—through
thoughtfully designed disability sports experiences. Leveraging the school’s
deep-rooted sporting culture, these programmes aim to create meaningful,
interest-driven, and authentic opportunities for students to serve the
community. By engaging in such experiences, students not only cultivate
empathy and social awareness but also actively contribute to building an
inclusive society. This approach is closely aligned with the vision of
Forward Singapore, which aspires towards a vibrant, fair, and united nation
where everyone is valued and respected.</p>

<p>Seng Kang Secondary is well-positioned to deliver such meaningful community
involvement because of the positive circumstances and strong school-based
structures in place. One key enabler is the school’s Values-in-Action (VIA)
programme, which is coordinated by the CCA groups. This structure naturally
brings together students with similar sporting interests, making it easier
to plan and execute initiatives that are both passion-driven and impactful.
By aligning community service opportunities with students’ existing strengths
and interests, the school fosters higher engagement, sustained commitment,
and a sense of shared purpose. This synergy between structured platforms
and authentic interest not only enhances the quality of the initiatives
but also ensures that students experience service as a fulfilling and integral
part of their school life.</p>
