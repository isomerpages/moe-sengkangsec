<p>Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) and Sengkang Community Hospital (SKCH)
form a vital part of Sengkang community in offering a wide spectrum clinics
which deliver multi-disciplinary and patient-centric care of all major
healthcare disciplines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes a village to achieve better health together and that village
begins with the hospitals. At SKH, they believe that every player in the
village is equally important in building a healthier community in the northeast.
Over the past years, they have strived with their alliance and community
partners to achieve their mission of Better Health Together. Great strides
have been made in fostering greater awareness of healthy living among residents,
as well as promoting greater collaboration with general practitioners (GPs)
to build healthier communities in Punggol and Sengkang. This is integral
to the hospitalâ€™s efforts and long-term commitment of encouraging residents
to take an active role in their own health care.</p>
<p>As part of the Seng Kang village,, Seng Kang Secondary School becomes
one of the official partners with the SKH and SKCH in mid 2018. Since then,
we actively participate in the hospital's various key events and our students
volunteer in aspects in helping the hospitals to build a healthier community
in the North-East of Singapore.</p>

<br>SKH believes we can harness the restorative and recuperative power of
the arts to help patients, staff and members of the community heal better.
As such SKH incorporates the arts holistically into their approach to patient
care with the healing process.</p>
<p>Our talented students made their contributions by putting up lunchtime
concerts at SKH, performing a repertoire of songs which help to boost the
health of the patients and visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Values in Action @ SKCH</strong>
<br>Our students showed their kindness and concern to the patients at Sengkang
Community Hospital by volunteering at the wards. The students aim is to
engage the patients actively and liven up the atmosphere in the wards by
inviting patients to participate in various activities which the students
have provided. These activities often bring joy to patients and provide
aid in their recovery process.</p>
