<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>To connect and engage Seng Kang graduates and build collegiality in building
the Seng Kang Secondary School spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>Every Seng Kang graduate is an active contributor to SKSS</p>
<p><strong>Alumni Activities</strong>
<br><strong>Alumni Tea and Networking Session - 7 October 2017</strong>
</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide an opportunity for Alumni to meet up and reconnect with one
another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a platform for the school to collaborate with the Alumni in
our envisioning exercise to bring SKSS to ‘The Next Breakthrough’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a very positive response to this event, with more than 100 former
students registering their interest to attend. The former students who
were present ranged from the graduates from 2002/2003, our pioneer batches,
to those who recently graduated in 2016. 68 of them registered officially
as our alumni, indicating their interests to contribute to the school in
various ways. They also provided invaluable inputs to the Principal, Mr
Koh, for the school’s re-envisioning exercise. It was really heartening
to meet so many of our former students who are keen to contribute back
to the school.</p>
<p><strong>Formation of 1st SKSS Alumni EXCO - 3 February 2018</strong>
<br>The school had invited the registered alumni, who had indicated their
interest to contribute to the school on a regular basis, for a meeting
on 3 February 2018, so that we could form an EXCO that will help to plan
programmes for the Alumni as well as support the school programmes. The
1st SKSS EXCO was formed at the end of the meeting with Melvin Seet (2003)
as the Chairperson and Tommy Yow (2003) as the Vice-Chairperson. The other
EXCO members are: Lionel Sim Chee Siang (2003), Desmond Ho Chin Sian (2003),
Clarissa Phang Chu Hui (2011), Fong Cui Mei (2012), Yeo Jia Hui, Abigail
(2012), Audrey Ang Yu Min (2015), Fahirah Safinah (2015), Tay Jie Xin (2015).</p>
<p><strong>Support for School Programmes and Events - Ongoing</strong>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Leaders’ Investiture</strong>
<br>Over the years, the school has invited our alumni who had previously served
as a student leader and have done well in their post-secondary education
and career, as the Guest-of-Honour (GOH) for our Student Leaders’ Investiture.
We were honoured to have Tan Meng Ying Claire (2015) as our GOH in 2019
and Chong Kok Pin, Patrick (2014) in 2018. Through their speeches, they
were able to share their experiences on how they have grown as leaders
in their own fields. We hope that their sharing will inspire our current
students to aspire to be confident and successful like them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NS Engagement Talk</strong>
<br>On 28 June 2018, one of our alumni, Low Tian Fu (2011) gave a talk to
our Secondary 4 and 5 students to share with them his post-secondary educational
and National Service experiences, and how these experiences have helped
to shape his choices and goals in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CCA Programmes</strong>
<br>Many of our alumni still feel a strong sense of commitment and belonging
to their respective CCAs in SKSS and choose to volunteer their time to
help out and contribute to the school through their CCAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Educational and Career Guidance (ECG) Talks</strong>
<br>In Semester 1 of 2019, one of our alumni, Muhammad Amirul Bin Osman shared
his personal experiences of his life as a student in SKSS to the Sec 4NT
students, and how he was able to attain Direct Admission to the ITE for
Aerospace Engineering through his hard work and determination, even before
sitting for his N Levels. He also shared with the students how he continued
his educational journey by pursuing a diploma in Republic Polytechnic to
inspire the students to be lifelong learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SKSS Open House - November 2018</strong>
<br>Many of our alumni came down to support their various CCAs during the
school’s Open House in November 2018 for the graduating Primary 6 students.
Our Alumni EXCO Vice-Chairperson, Tommy Yow, and alumni member, Lee Meng
Joon, were also present to support the school in reaching out to the P6
parents by sharing with them their own experiences in the school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Participation in School Events</strong>
<br>Our Alumni EXCO were invited to attend and participate in various school
events such as the Chinese New Year Mass Lo Hei sessions in 2018 and 2019
and the school’s Speech Day in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Alumni Flagship Programme</strong>
<br><strong>SKSS 20th Anniversary Homecoming Dinner - 17 November 2018</strong>
<br>In commemoration of the school’s 20th anniversary, a Homecoming Dinner
was organised last year for former students and staff to reconnect with
one another. Approximately 300 former students and staff, and 150 current
staff and students attended the Homecoming Dinner. Many of our former students
and staff were excited to be back and meet old friends and teachers, as
they took a trip down memory lane and also saw how the school has changed
and progressed over the years. The teachers were also proud to see how
our students have grown and developed into fine, young ladies and gentlemen,
each doing well in their own respective fields. Thank you to all alumni
who performed during the dinner and to the EXCO for helping to reach out
to more former students and publicising the event. Thank you also to all
who were present and had contributed in making the event a success.</p>
