Our Beginning: A New Secondary School in Sengkang New Town <br>
Seng Kang Secondary School was established on 04 January 1999, making it the first secondary school in the Sengkang housing estate.

The school was first located in the former premises of Hai Sing Girls’ High at 1192 Upper Serangoon Road until 12 March 1999, before it moved to its present site at 10 Compassvale Lane. The school was built at a cost of $23 million, on 3 hectares of land. It was officially opened by Mr Lee Yock Suan, the then Minister for Information and the Arts on 14 July 2001.

The school started with a teaching staff of 4 Heads of Departments (HODs) and 10 teachers, led by the first Principal., Mdm Ng Shok Yan. There were 7 secondary one classes with a total student population of 283.

The school’s first Mission statement: ‘The Seng Kang Secondary School pupil is morally upright, thinks creatively and puts family, school and nation before self.’

Seng Kang Secondary School held its official opening on the 14th of July 2001. The Guest of Honour was Mr Lee Yock Suan, Minister for Information and the Arts. He officiated the ceremony and declared the school open. The students displayed their projects for the visitors. The crowd was entertained by an Arts Fiesta. Some of our students enjoyed their portraits being drawn. Some even had a taste of henna designs drawn onto their palms. The guests watched the performances while having their dinner. Seng Kang Youths were partying towards the end of the day. Some of our staff disguised themselves as fairy tale characters and paraded around in the school. The public was treated to some traditional games at different stalls and stations. It was indeed a most memorable day for many of our students.

The anchor represents the Sengkang district which was once a harbour. It also signifies the school’s determination to anchor to its beliefs. The anchor and rope combine to form the initials of the school, Seng Kang Secondary. At the base of the anchor is the school motto, ‘Breakthrough’ which reflects the undaunting and tireless spirit of the school in its continuous search for new ideas to improve itself.
