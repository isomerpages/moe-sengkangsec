**<font size=6>Art Unit</font>**

**<font size=5>Beliefs</font>**

We are dedicated to developing self-directed learners and critical thinkers. Their determination to create profoundly personal and technically competent works of art is of utmost importance. 

  
**<font size=5>Signature Programmes</font>**

**Lower Secondary:** 

Our students go through vigorous exercises on idea creation and expansion. Through exposure to a wide array of art, they learn to hone their skills and demonstrate their creativity. In the studio, students discuss topics that relate to themes like existence and connections to our world.<br>
They work towards finding their places in the world and expressing their interpretations of things and events around them. 
Basic Photography was introduced to give the students greater exposure to art outside of the classroom and encourage them to appreciate art from different perspectives.

**Upper Secondary:** 

The Art students are exposed to a wide range of art mediums and skills to prepare them for their national examinations and aid in their personal growth.<br>
In the studio, they are encouraged to express their individual thoughts and share constructive feedback to help each other grow. 
The Printmaking and Ceramics Module was reintroduced to the upper secondary students to expose students to hands-on art making and to help them develop their skills by exploring a myriad of art techniques.
