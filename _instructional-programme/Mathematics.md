**<font size=5>Beliefs</font>**

In Seng Kang Secondary School, teachers apply a range of strategies and approaches to deliver the understanding of Mathematical concepts and help students find motivation and meaning in learning mathematics. Through instructions, reasoning, problem-solving, and discourse, teachers support students in making sense of mathematics concepts and encourage perseverance in the productive struggle to solve mathematics problems. 

The Mathematics programme spans across four years in a progression that ensures the foundation of numbers, algebra, geometry, graphing, and statistics are instilled in students as they progress the depth of the mathematics syllabus at Seng Kang Secondary School.

Students will be given ample opportunities to develop problem-solving skills and higher order thinking skills.  Group work is planned in the curriculum to allow students to collaborate and learn together.  Students will also be given authentic tasks to allow them to explore and apply what they have learnt in the classroom and connect the concepts to the world outside.  Activities and manipulatives are incorporated into pedagogical methodologies in a structured approach to better engage low-progress learners to develop their appreciation and positive attitude towards mathematics.  

Mathematical understanding is measured through the use of a variety of assessment strategies and tasks.  Assessments are planned to support learning and help make teachers and students make adjustments to instruction and learning.

**<font size=5>Achievements and Recognition</font>**

ICAN-trained (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) teachers apply ICAN strategies to better engage and level-up mathematics proficiency of lower progress learners, addressing key areas of learning gaps, language, motivation and sustenance of knowledge in our students.

Talented students participate in Singapore Math Olympiad (SMO) competitions.  Participation in the SMO provided the students with a platform to challenge themselves and further develop their thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills.  

  
**<font size=5>Collaborative Learning</font>**

The Mathematics department aims to develop students to be independent and self-sufficient learners who are able to work collaboratively. Students are given ample opportunities to co-construct their own learning through group work and peer discussions in class. 

  
**<font size=5>Joy of Learning</font>**

To sustain interest in Mathematics and to ignite the joy of learning, mini-competitions and fun events are organized for the whole school.  In one event, staff and students were invited to

estimate the number of balls that were enclosed in a clear display case. In another event, a Mathematics Easter Egg Hunt was organized, whereby participants hunt for the Easter eggs and solve the mathematics questions.

**<font size=5>Support and Enrichment</font>**

Structured baseline remediation programme is planned for all levels to assist students to achieve expected competencies in core mathematics skills. 

The Covid-19 pandemic has presented some challenges for teaching mathematics as teachers were forced to continue lessons in a fully remote learning approach.  However, relevant mathematics resources were collated quickly and implemented to achieve effective online teaching during Home Based Learning.
