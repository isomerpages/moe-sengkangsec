**<font size=5>CCA Beliefs</font>**<br>
We believe that character education forms the basis of a good education. We embrace and inculcate important values in our footballers such as:

School Values  

*   Respect
*   Responsibility 
*   Resilience <br>

Values in Sports  

*   Teamwork
*   Sportsmanship

Every year, our B and C Division teams would participate in the National Schools Games from January to August. From June to October, our Centre of Excellence team participates in the FAS Centre of Excellence U15 Developmental League. From August to September, our two Futsal teams take part in the Singapore Pools FAS Inter-School Futsal Tournament. Throughout the year, our school team participates in friendly matches with teams from other schools. During the off-season period, the boys dedicate their time to work on their fitness and team-bonding at their end-of-year camp. The players can look forward to representing the school in numerous competitions that develop them professionally.

From June to October, our Centre of Excellence Football Team participated in the FAS Centre of Excellence U15 Developmental League. From August to September, our two futsal teams take part in the Singapore Pools FAS Inter-school Futsal Tournament 2019.

Throughout the year, our school play friendly matches with various schools. During the off-season period, the boys spent more time working on their fitness and team-bonding in a year-end camp. In our football CCA, the players can look forward to representing the school in the many competitions that seek to develop the players professionally. 

We are deeply appreciative of the continued strong and loyal supporters of both parents and students alike, as their fervent encouragement and support gave us the motivation to play for the school. Through these activities, the players have learnt to be more resilient and self-disciplined. Their actions echo what our players always cheer before a game, “Majulah, Sengkang!”
