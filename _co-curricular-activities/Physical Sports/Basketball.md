**<font size=5>CCA Beliefs</font>**<br>
We believe in developing our student athletes to embody the school values of Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Self-discipline and Excellence, as well as to display sportsmanship. We encourage our students to persevere when faced with challenging and tough situations, and to build their mental dexterity. 

  
**<font size=5>Affirmation & Recognition</font>**<br>
We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our seniors who have contributed to the various inter-school competitions such as the North Zone Basketball Championships and the Yio Chu Kang Cup. Thank you so much for your dedication!
