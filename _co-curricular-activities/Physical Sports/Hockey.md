<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong>
<br>The Hockey CCA at Seng Kang Secondary School aims not only to provide
students with hockey playing skills, but it also places great emphasis
on the character building of every player. This is done through team bonding
camps, overseas training trips and mental skills training sessions. Students
who enroll in the CCA are given the opportunity to participate in friendly
matches and tournaments.</p>
