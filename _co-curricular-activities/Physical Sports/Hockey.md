<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>The Hockey CCA at Seng Kang Secondary School aims not only to provide students with hockey playing skills, but it also places great emphasis on the character building of every player. This is done through team bonding camps, overseas training trips and mental skills training sessions. Students who enrol in the CCA are given the opportunity to participate in friendly matches and tournaments.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>2019 National Schools Games Hockey Championships<br>B Division Boys - Nationals 4th<br>B Division Girls - Plate Champion</p><p>2019 Singapore Hockey Federation National Junior League<br>Division 2 Boys - Champion<br>Division 1 Girls - 7th&nbsp;</p><p>2018 National Schools Games Hockey Championships<br>B Division Boys - Nationals 1st Runner-up<br>B Division Girls - Nationals 6th<br>C Division Boys - Nationals 1st Runner-up<br>C Division Girls - Nationals Champion</p><p>2018 Singapore Hockey Federation National Junior League<br>Division 2 Girls - 1st Runner-up</p><p>ActiveSG2018 Year End Hockey Smash Carnival<br>Boys Team 1 - Champions<br>Boys Team 2- 1st Runner-up</p><p>Many of the players in the team were awarded the Singapore Sports Council Award and went on to play the sport at the next level in junior college, polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education.
