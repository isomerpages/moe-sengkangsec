<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong>
    <br>Our Girl Guides Unit – SKY Guides activities are planned with the 5-Point
    Programme as the foundation. Covering an array of skills and knowledge
    from Personal &amp; Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International
    aspects. Guides complete the various clauses to earn their proficiency
    and interest badges. They also participate in competitions, advocacy and
    service-learning projects held on a Unit, division or national scale. We
    provide valuable Girl-Led opportunities for SKY Guides to build self-confidence,
    take action to make a difference and uphold the BP (Be Prepared) spirit.</p>
