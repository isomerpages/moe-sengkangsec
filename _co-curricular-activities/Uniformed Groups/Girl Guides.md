<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>Our Girl Guides Unit – SKY Guides activities are planned with the 5-Point Programme as the foundation. Covering an array of skills and knowledge from Personal &amp; Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International aspects. Guides complete the various clauses to earn their proficiency and interest badges. They also participate in competitions, advocacy and service-learning projects held on a Unit, division or national scale. We provide valuable Girl-Led opportunities for SKY Guides to build self-confidence, take action to make a difference and uphold the BP (Be Prepared) spirit.</p><p></p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br><strong>Baden-Powell Award</strong><br>The Baden Powell Award (BPA) is the highest award given out by our Chief Commissioner to a Girl Guide.</p><p>Awardee for 2021 and 2022:</p><p>1.
