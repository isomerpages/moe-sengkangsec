<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>In the National Police Cadet Corps, our cadets are exposed to a myriad of opportunities and learning experiences to develop themselves to become civic-minded citizens and community leaders. From completing theoretical courses on crime prevention and anti-narcotics to practical applications under the Community Safety and Security Programme and the Police Youth Ambassador Programme, cadets undergo rigorous training to build their confidence and skills. We firmly believe in the development of each cadet, in terms of their character, leadership and resilience, and aim to inculcate in them a spirit of service to the school and the community.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>The National Police Cadets Corps is proud to announce that we have attained Gold for the Unit Overall Proficiency Award for the second consecutive year. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our seniors who have continued to guide and lead us through the CCA sessions (online and offline) that we have had in this special year. Thank you so much for your dedication.</p><p><strong>CCA Training Sessions</strong><br>Wednesday, 1530 â€“ 1800h</p><p><strong>Teachers in charge</strong><br></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name/Designation</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Email Address</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Teo Chun Min (OIC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>teo_chun_min@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Mohammad Zulkiffli Bin Abu Bakar</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>mohammad_zulkiffli_abu_bakar@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Wan Kuan Yi</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>wan_kuan_yi@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
