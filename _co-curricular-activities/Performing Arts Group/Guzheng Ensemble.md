<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>SKSS is a closely-knitted community bonded together by a common love for music. Our CCA goals are:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To inculcate in our members an appreciation of music and culture</p></li><li><p>To provide opportunities for our students to pursue and excel in their talent and passion</p></li><li><p>To develop strength of character and resilience in our members</p></li></ul><p>SKSS Guzheng values teamwork, unity, discipline and commitment. In their time with the Guzheng ensemble, members are encouraged to work hard with one another, forge precious friendships and acquire lifelong skills. Members are also provided with annual performance opportunites at both school and community events to showcase their hard work. In SKSS Guzheng, we believe that “Once a Guzheng member, you are forever a member of our family”. The members of SKSS Guzheng Ensemble will continue to do our best and strive to greater heights.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation - Certificate of Distinction<br></p><p><strong>CCA Training Sessions</strong><br>Wednesdays 3.30pm to 6.00pm <br>Fridays 3.00pm to 6.00pm (Odd week only)</p><p></p><p><strong>Teachers-In-Charge</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name/Designation</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Email Address</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Kho Hui Han (OIC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>kho_hui_han@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Chew Jing Qi Selina</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>chew_jing_qi_selina@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Chng Lee Na (Instructor)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p></p>
