<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>SKSS is a closely-knitted community bonded together by a common love for music. Our CCA goals are:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To inculcate in our members an appreciation of music and culture</p></li><li><p>To provide opportunities for our students to pursue and excel in their talent and passion</p></li><li><p>To develop strength of character and resilience in our members</p></li></ul><p>SKSS Guzheng values teamwork, unity, discipline and commitment. In their time with the Guzheng ensemble, members are encouraged to work hard with one another, forge precious friendships and acquire lifelong skills. Members are also provided with annual performance opportunites at both school and community events to showcase their hard work. In SKSS Guzheng, we believe that “Once a Guzheng member, you are forever a member of our family”. The members of SKSS Guzheng Ensemble will continue to do our best and strive to greater heights.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation - Certificate of Distinction<br></p><p><strong>CCA Training Sessions</strong><br>Wednesdays 3.30pm to 6.00pm <br>Fridays 3.00pm to 6.00pm (Odd week only)</p><p></p><p><strong>Teachers-In-Charge</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name/Designation</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Email Address</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Kho Hui Han (OIC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>kho_hui_han@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Chew Jing Qi Selina</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>chew_jing_qi_selina@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Chng Lee Na (Instructor)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Guzheng Ensemble Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2023" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/SYF_2023.jpg"></div><p>Guzheng Ensemble Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2023<br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/Full_Costume.jpg"></div><p>Seng Kang Secondary School Guzheng Ensemble with their full costume and Guzheng instruments; “Once a Guzheng member, you are forever a member of our family”</p><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/Chiang_Mai.jpg"></div><p>Secondary 3s Guzheng Ensemble and Red Cross Youth students going to Chiang Mai, Thailand to learn more about their culture</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/Open_House3_2023.jpg"></div><p>Happy faces of Guzheng Ensemble students performing during SKSS Open House in 2023</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/Experience_Day_and_Tryouts_5.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Guzheng Ensemble/Experience_Day_and_Tryouts_4.jpg"></div><p>CCA Experience Day and Tryouts for new Secondary 1 students, Guzheng Ensemble seniors are working hard to prepare a fruitful session by performing a short snippet of a song and also sharing more about the CCA to the Secondary 1 students.</p>
