**<font size=6>Guzheng Ensemble</font>**

**<font size=5>CCA Beliefs</font>**<br>
SKSS Guzheng Ensemble is a closely-knitted community of students, teachers-in-charge and instructor. Students are bonded together by their common appreciation of music. Our CCA goals are:

  

*   To inculcate in our members an appreciation of music and culture
*   To provide opportunities for our students to pursue and excel in their talent and passion
*   To develop strength of character and resilience in our members

  

We value teamwork, unity, discipline and commitment. Each member is encouraged to work hard together, forge precious friendships and acquire skills that will last a lifetime. In Guzheng@SKSS, there is a saying, “Once a Guzheng member, you are forever a member of our family”. The members of SKSS Guzheng Ensemble will continue to do our best and strive for greater heights.
