<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>We are an inclusive CCA for all looking to find their place and sense of purpose in this increasingly complex world. From social issues to interpersonal relationships, we seek to provide our members with opportunities to explore a wide range of topics. Through the emphasis of our values – discipline, resilience, adaptability, mastery and adventure – we hope to equip all members with acting and backstage management skills that will translate to preparing them to become global citizens. Our goal is that all members grow to become holistic learners and will have the passion to pursue and better appreciate the arts.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation: Certificate of Accomplishment</p><p><strong>CCA Training Sessions</strong><br>Wednesdays 3pm - 6pm<br>Fridays (Odd Weeks only) 2.30pm–5.30pm</p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name/Designation</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Email Address</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Gabriel Lee (OIC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>lee_jing_an_gabriel@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms J Thivyadarishini</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>J_Thivyadarishini@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
