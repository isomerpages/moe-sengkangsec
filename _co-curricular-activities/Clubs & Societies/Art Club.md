<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Art Club aims to foster a love for the visual arts, encourage self-expression,
and provide a collaborative space for student artists of all skill levels.
Whether you are a beginner exploring your creativity or an experienced
artist looking to refine your skills, we believe everyone has the potential
to be creative.</p>
<p>The Art Club provides its members with the opportunities to express themselves
creatively through taking part in art competitions and programmes to boost
their artistic confidence and creative thinking skills. It also creates
various opportunities for talented SKY to showcase their artistic abilities
outside of their regular curriculum.</p>
