<p><strong>CCA Beliefs</strong><br>The Media Services Club provides students with the opportunity to get their hands on a wide spectrum of media devices. Through the CCA training programmes, students develop their skills in audiography, photography, and videography. These are all skills that are needed to run school events daily. The Media Services Club is vital in ensuring that every event and programme conducted in school is carried out well.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong><br>2023 <br>Completed Courses: <br>a) Game Development<br>b) Cyber Security<br>Conducted by Roboto Academy</p><p>2022<br>Awards:<br>a) IMDA Digital @ Youth Media Awards Final Shortlist 2022<br>b) Copyright School Challenge Video Competition GOLD Award 2022 (Produced by Heng Kai Ling)</p><p>Completed Course:<br>Immersive Media conducted by Apple Inc Make-The-Change</p><p></p><p><strong>CCA Training Sessions</strong><br>Mondays 3:00pm - 4:30pm (Post-production)<br>Wednesdays 3:15pm - 5:30pm (Training)</p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name/Designation</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Email Address</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Lee Chee Yeon (OIC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>lee_chee_yeon@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Jasmine Ngoh</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>jasmine_ngoh_xin_rong@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Lim Bao Luo Paul</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>lim_bao_luo_paul@moe.edu.sg</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Media%20Services%20Club.png"></div><p></p>
