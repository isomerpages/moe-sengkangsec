**<font size=6>Media Services Club</font>**

**<font size=5>CCA Beliefs</font>**<br>
The Media Services Club provides students with the opportunity to get their hands on a wide spectrum of media devices. Through the CCA training programmes, students develop their skills in audiography, photography, and videography. These are all skills that are needed to run school events daily. The Media Services Club is vital in ensuring that every event and programme conducted in school is carried out well.
