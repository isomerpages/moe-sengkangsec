<p><strong><u>An Interview with Jaerel Ang (4-1), Recipient of the SPF-NPCC Badge</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your award, Jaerel! What was your reaction like when you received news that you were awarded the SPF-NPCC Badge? Tell us more.</strong>
</p>
<p>I was elated when I first heard the news! It exceeded my expectations.
I was informed of the good news by Mr Noah Zhang and Ms Amanda Lee. What
added to my joy was the fact that it was shared with me by both of them
– they helped me immensely in my years in NPCC and in preparing for the
interview for the badge. I was so eager to share the moment with my friends
as well when I first heard the good news.</p>
<p><strong>What was the awards ceremony like? Can you share more about what happened there?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents and loved ones could be invited to the award ceremony, so the
mood was boisterous in the auditorium. Before going on stage, I was, of
course, nervous. My parents were overjoyed for me, and their support helped
to calm me down.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe your journey in NPCC over the years?</strong>
</p>
<p>I feel that I have grown immensely as a person over the years. I was more
reserved in my lower secondary days. As I was given the role of AUL (Assistant
Unit Leader) of Administration and Integrated Planning in Secondary 3,
I seized the opportunity to learn and grow. I feel that my experiences
have helped me grow as a leader.</p>
<p>One particularly memorable experience was my first project, which was
the Area Games Day. Participants from NPCC units from various schools came
together to take part in games. My role was to plan a game for them. &nbsp;I
had to send proposals to my CIs (Cadet Inspectors). Repeatedly, I received
proposals that were sent back to me and I was initially frustrated. However,
upon reflection, I realised that I had missed out on important things in
my planning. My seniors were trying to help me grow and ensure the event
was planned better. Ultimately, the planning was improved, and the event
was a success. It was a satisfying experience to hear of the positive reception
of the participants.</p>
<p><strong>What were some values or qualities that you picked up along your NPCC journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>I have become more resilient, because of not giving up when planning for
events, and while undergoing the various challenges in NPCC. I have also
learnt to be more adaptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking back at your NPCC journey, what would you have done differently?</strong>
</p>
<p>I could have taken more initiative when I was younger. I only realised
my potential later in my secondary school years and took on my responsibilities
thereafter. If I could speak to my past self, I would tell him to seize
the day. I would wholeheartedly encourage my juniors to take the opportunities
given to them. To the Secondary 1 students who have just joined the NPCC
family, I would advise them to focus on building their skills and doing
their best in the activities.</p>
<p><strong>Before we end the interview, can you share what your plans are after graduation?</strong>
</p>
<p>Past NPCC cadets do come back to help as CIs. It is a rather commitment-heavy
but meaningful endeavour. I am considering it, but I am happy to help out,
in any way, with the unit should I be called upon.</p>
<p>As for my education pathway, I hope to be enrolled in Diploma in Cybersecurity
&amp; Digital Forensics at Temasek Polytechnic. The area of cybersecurity
has been my interest from young. Over the years in NPCC, my participation
in cybersecurity-related activities has also piqued my interest in this
area. &nbsp;</p>
